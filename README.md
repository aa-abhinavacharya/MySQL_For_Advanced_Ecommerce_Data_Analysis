This project was prepared with the assistance of the course [Advanced SQL: MySQL for Ecommerce Data Analysis](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/) on Udemy.


# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

This project analyzes eCommerce data using the Maven Fuzzy Factory database, which consists of six interrelated tables. The dataset includes comprehensive information on website activity, products, and orders and refunds. By leveraging MySQL, the project explores how customers access and interact with the website, evaluates landing page performance and conversion rates, and investigates product-level sales trends. The insights gained aim to provide a deeper understanding of user behavior, product performance, and refund patterns, contributing to data-driven decision-making in an eCommerce context.
